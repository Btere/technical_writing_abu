This repository showcases a range of technical writing projects that is posted on different social media platform Linkedln, Medium, X among others, demonstrating our ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly and concisely. It includes:

* **Deploying Models on Edge Devices:** This project explores the challenges and best practices for deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained devices, such as IoT devices and mobile phones.
* **Data Class:** This project delves into the concept of data classes in Python, a powerful tool for organizing and structuring data in a concise and efficient manner.
* **High-Accuracy Models Without Perfect Data:** This project investigates techniques for achieving high accuracy in machine learning models even when faced with imperfect or noisy data.

By working on these projects, we have gained valuable insights into the technical writing process, including:
* Writing clear and concise documentation
* Explaining complex concepts in simple terms
* Creating effective tutorials and guides
* Sharing knowledge with a diverse audience

We continue to refine our technical writing skills and expand our knowledge across various industries.
